â›” DEPRECATED. The following example demonstrates how to implement an external search panel in the Data Grid for Blazor. The Data Grid was moved to maintenance support mode. No new features/capabilities will be added to this component. We recommend that you [migrate](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/403162/grid/migrate-from-data-grid-to-grid) to the [Grid](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/403143/grid) component that ships with an integrated [Search Box](https://docs.devexpress.com/Blazor/404142/grid/search-box).
